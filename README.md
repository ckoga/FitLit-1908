# GitFit Activity Tracker

GitFit (previously known as FitLit) is an activity tracking application that is designed to test a developers understanding of prototype methods and TDD.  Given data on 50 users over three months GitFit forces a developer to plan and create classes all while trying to maintain a good TDD work flow.  The emphasis on TDD really helps highlight the importance of good testing, putting the data on the DOM was a lot easier knowing exactly what the output of each method is.  Class planning was vital as well trying to make sure all class were encapsulated but not too tightly bound to other classes.  

### Installation instructions:
Fork and clone this repo, then run npm install to download: jQuery, Mocha and Chai.  You will also see Chai-spies and Charts.js, two other packages that will be implemented in later.

There is no boilerplate for testing in this starter-kit repo. You will need to set this up yourself. However, if you ran `npm install`, then the tooling you need to start testing is already installed (`mocha` and `chai`).
